//! Pass a question to the owner (R8.3): `POST /ask/pass` on a site's host.
//!
//! When Ask can't answer, it offers to pass the question on. The visitor sends
//! `{question, contact?}`. The question is at most 500 characters and the contact (how the owner
//! can reply) at most 120, both stripped of control characters. Each client IP may pass at most
//! [`PER_HOUR`] questions an hour. The question is stored as data through a [`QuestionSink`]
//! and never reaches a model. The reply is plain words.
