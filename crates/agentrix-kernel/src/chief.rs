//! The Chief WebAgent answering the owner: one entry point for every surface (chat, voice, the
//! console), with real inference and read tools (05 §2.1, the `owner-questions` job).
//!
//! [`answer`] runs a tool loop through the Model Gateway (purpose `brief`, OpenAI wire with
//! `tools`): the model asks for the records it needs, each tool reads them, and the answer cites
//! what it used ("From today's orders: 3 placed, 1 waiting for payment").
//! - **Read only.** No tool changes anything. Anything that would act is a decision card the
//!   owner approves in the console; the Chief says so instead of doing it.
//! - **Dials.** The owner's `owner-questions` dial is checked first; each tool is checked
//!   against the dial of the WebAgent whose records it reads ([`Rosters::check`] with
//!   [`Effect::Read`]). A tool the dials refuse isn't offered, and the model is told why.
//! - **Bounds.** At most [`MAX_ROUNDS`] tool rounds and [`BUDGET`] in all; then one last call
//!   without tools, and plain words if the gateway can't answer at all.
//! - **Honest data.** Tools read recorded rows only: the samples' records (W2's `records.db`),
//!   decision cards (the first release's and W5's v2), the gateway's spend and limits (W8's metrics),
//!   receipts and the roster. A site that keeps no such records gets "none recorded", never a
//!   guess. Customers' emails and phone numbers never reach the model.
