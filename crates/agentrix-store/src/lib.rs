//! Platform core (W8): the data and plumbing the product stands on.
//!
//! - [`metrics`]: the read side behind every number the owner console, the control plane and
//!   the home page show. [`metrics::Metrics`] is the trait the consoles call;
//!   [`metrics::SqliteMetrics`] reads Brick 1's `control.db` and the Model Gateway's `usage`.
//! - [`catalogue`]: every number the concepts draw, its source, and the honest words to show
//!   while it has none (specs/platform/03-data.md §7).
//! - [`visits`]: visit counts without trackers (06 §4.9): the beacon endpoint, daily totals,
//!   and reports with cells under 5 shown as "fewer than 5".
//! - [`health`]: the checks behind the public status page.
//! - [`store`]: the store layer (contract C5): a store per site, per-site blobs, a hash-chained
//!   site log that issues receipts, and the outbox. Not wired into node yet.
//! - [`mount`] and [`migrate`]: how node runs this crate (contract C11): the status page,
//!   the home page's numbers, loopback JSON reads, and the background checks.
//! - [`subject`]: `control.db`'s personal data about a customer (questions passed on, orders
//!   placed by agents) as one more store in W6's "Download my data" and "Delete my account".
//! - [`time`] and [`words`]: windows, stored times, and numbers as people read them.
//!
//! This crate's tables (`visit_counts`, `usage_purposes`, `health_hours`, and the rebuilt
//! `usage`) live in `control.db` and come from its own migrator in `migrations/control/`, numbered in
//! W8's range (0800–0899), tracked in `_sqlx_migrations_store`.
