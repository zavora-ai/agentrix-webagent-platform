//! The Effects Gateway, first slice (02 §4.3, ADR-004, ADR-006, contract C3): money moves only
//! through here, once per fingerprint, with a receipt, and never with card data on our hosts.
//! Owner: W6 (identity, payments and trust). PayPal only (James, Sun 8 Nov), sandbox.
//!
//! - **Checkout** for the sample sites ([`Effects::create_payment`], [`Effects::capture`]):
//!   PayPal Orders v2. The customer approves on PayPal's own page; we keep PayPal's ids and
//!   the amounts. The same site + order + amount gives the same PayPal order, and a second
//!   capture returns the first result.
//! - **Refunds** are owner decisions: [`Effects::refund_request`] builds the `EffectRequest`
//!   W5 puts on a card; [`Effects::refund`] runs only with the approval of that exact
//!   fingerprint, and never above what was captured.
//! - **Plans** in USD ([`Effects::start_subscription`]): PayPal Subscriptions, with the
//!   provider's side kept in `plan_subscriptions` for W3's billing.
//! - **Webhooks** (`POST /effects/paypal/webhook` on the platform host): only events PayPal's
//!   signature check accepts, each handled once.
//! - Every outcome is `executed`, `not_executed` or `unknown` (U27); unknown is settled by
//!   reading PayPal back ([`Effects::reconcile`]), never by retrying blind.
//!
//! Without the sandbox keys (`AGENTRIX_PAYPAL_FILE` empty or missing) every call answers
//! [`EffectError::NotConfigured`] with "Payments aren't switched on for this sample yet.
//! Nothing was charged." Horizon 2 moves this crate into its own process and user, the only
//! holder of provider keys.
