//! Where a card may be decided (07 §4.4; concept/console/phone.html, "the same decisions, with
//! fewer powers"). One rule table for every surface, so a card can't be approved somewhere with
//! weaker checks:
//!
//! | Surface  | May decide                                                 | Never                          |
//! |----------|------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
//! | App      | everything; money, publishing and high risk with a passkey | details in a notification      |
//! | WhatsApp | allow once or decline everyday cards; STOP freezes         | money, high risk, unfreeze     |
//! | Voice    | allow once or decline everyday cards; stop everything      | money, publishing, high risk   |
//! | Email    | nothing: the brief and the weekly review, with links       | approvals (easy to forge)      |
//!
//! Anything a surface can't decide goes out as a short link, [`short_link`], that opens the card
//! in the console after sign-in.
