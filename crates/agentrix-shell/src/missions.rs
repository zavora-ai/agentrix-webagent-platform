//! Missions (07 §3.5; concept/console/mission.html): the owner says a goal in their own words,
//! the Chief WebAgent drafts the contract from them through the Model Gateway ([`draft`]: what
//! counts, who's named on it, when it ends), the owner checks the draft and approves it as a card
//! v2; then the mission counts its measure from what was recorded. A mission never raises any
//! job's level.
//!
//! What a mission doesn't do yet: no WebAgent works towards it in the background. That needs the
//! back-office runtime (W1's Horizon 2, `agentrix-kernel`'s note); until then a mission is the
//! owner's goal and its count, and the pages say so.
