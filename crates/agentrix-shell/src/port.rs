//! What the shell reads: the port between the shell's pages and the platform.
//!
//! `agentrix-node` implements [`ShellPort`] over Brick 1's console reads (`pages::ConsoleReads`
//! and `pages::map`), the approval ceremony (`auth::Approvals` through `decisions::Approver`)
//! and the receipts store. Wherever Brick 1 already builds a view model, the port hands that
//! model back (`agentrix_console::view`), so a page in the shell shows exactly what Brick 1's
//! page showed, from the same reads. Values the shell needs that Brick 1 never built are small
//! rows defined here.
