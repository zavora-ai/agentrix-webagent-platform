## Rebuild any of it

```sh
specs/submission/render.sh deck     # the PDF, from deck/deck.html
specs/submission/render.sh cover    # the cover, the deck's first slide at 1920 x 1080
python3 specs/submission/video/rec.py home specs/submission/video/clips/home.mp4   # a live capture
python3 specs/submission/video/build.py --final                                    # the video
```

- [`video/rec.py`](video/rec.py) drives headless Chrome on its own profile against the live site
  and streams its screencast into ffmpeg, so a capture runs in real time and leaves no frames on
  disk. The Move, which needs James's passkey, is recorded from his screen with `screencapture`.
- [`video/speak.py`](video/speak.py) speaks the narration through Vultr Serverless Inference
  (`qwen3-tts-12hz-1.7b`, about $0.08 for the whole video). The key is parsed from the main
  checkout's `.env` and never printed.
- [`video/build.py`](video/build.py) puts the beats together. Captions and the "Live" badge are
  drawn by [`video/overlay.html`](video/overlay.html) in the site's own type. `--final` refuses
  to build while any live capture is missing.

## Honesty

Every number in these files comes from a receipt, the usage meter or a dated measurement, and
says which. `TODO(live)`, `[[…]]` and the deck's `LIVE` table mark what the live run on Vultr
routes still has to supply. Nothing is filled in by hand.
